# Kotlin Mastery Project

A comprehensive learning resource for mastering Kotlin from beginner to advanced level. This project provides structured modules, practical examples, real-world projects, and extensive exercises to help you become proficient in Kotlin programming.

## üéØ Project Overview

This learning project is designed as a complete curriculum covering:

- **Basics**: Fundamental syntax, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming
- **Intermediate**: Collections, advanced functions, generics, delegation, and advanced OOP concepts
- **Advanced**: Coroutines, functional programming, metaprogramming, type system, and multiplatform development
- **Projects**: Progressive real-world applications from simple console apps to complex systems
- **Exercises**: Coding challenges, Kotlin Koans, and algorithmic problems
- **References**: Best practices, integration examples, and performance guidelines

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üìö Module Structure

### Basics Module (`/basics/`)
Foundation concepts for Kotlin programming:
- **Syntax**: Variables, data types, null safety, string templates
- **Control Flow**: Conditional expressions, loops, when statements
- **Functions**: Declaration, expressions, higher-order functions, extensions
- **OOP**: Classes, inheritance, data classes, enum classes

### Intermediate Module (`/intermediate/`)
Advanced language features and patterns:
- **Collections**: Lists, sets, maps, and functional operations
- **Advanced Functions**: Lambdas, scope functions, inline functions
- **Generics**: Type parameters, variance, constraints
- **Delegation**: Class and property delegation patterns
- **Advanced OOP**: Sealed classes, object declarations, nested classes

### Advanced Module (`/advanced/`)
Expert-level topics and modern Kotlin:
- **Coroutines**: Async programming, structured concurrency, Flow API
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions, immutability, monads
- **Metaprogramming**: Reflection, annotations, compile-time features
- **Type System**: Advanced generics, inline classes, type aliases
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques and best practices
- **Multiplatform**: Sharing code across JVM, JS, and Native

### Projects Module (`/projects/`)
Real-world applications demonstrating concepts:
- **Beginner**: Console calculator, banking system, address book
- **Intermediate**: HTTP client, web scraper, CLI tools
- **Advanced**: Web server, reactive systems, DSL creation

### Exercises Module (`/exercises/`)
Practice problems and coding challenges:
- **Beginner**: 50+ syntax and basic concept exercises
- **Intermediate**: 50+ OOP and collections challenges
- **Advanced**: 50+ coroutines and functional programming problems
- **Kotlin Koans**: All koans with detailed explanations
- **Algorithmic**: LeetCode-style problems with Kotlin solutions

### References Module (`/references/`)
Guidelines and integration examples:
- **Best Practices**: Coding conventions, common patterns, anti-patterns
- **Integration**: Spring Boot, Android, Ktor, database access examples

## üéì Learning Path

We recommend following the structured learning path outlined in [learning-path.md](learning-path.md), which provides:
